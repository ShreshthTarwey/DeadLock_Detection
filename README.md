# Explanation of `DeadlockDetector` Class Constructor

The `DeadlockDetector` class constructor is used to initialize various properties and setup configurations necessary for detecting deadlocks in the system. Below is the breakdown of each property and method used:

## Instance Properties

- **`this.processes`**: Initializes the number of processes in the system. Default value is set to `0`.
- **`this.resources`**: Initializes the number of resources in the system. Default value is set to `0`.
- **`this.allocationMatrix`**: An empty array that will hold the allocation matrix representing the current allocation of resources to processes.
- **`this.maximumMatrix`**: An empty array that will store the maximum resource requirements of each process.
- **`this.totalInstances`**: An array to store the total number of available instances for each resource.
- **`this.network`**: Initializes as `null`. This is likely used to store a network/graph structure for visualizing process and resource interactions.
- **`this.nodes`**: Initializes an empty set of nodes using `vis.DataSet()`. These nodes will represent processes and resources in the network graph.
- **`this.edges`**: Initializes an empty set of edges using `vis.DataSet()`. These edges will represent relationships between processes and resources.
- **`this.animationInProgress`**: A boolean flag set to `false` to indicate that no animation is in progress when the class is instantiated.
- **`this.processTypes`**: An array containing types of processes in the system, e.g., CPU, Memory, I/O, Network, Database.
- **`this.resourceTypes`**: An array containing types of resources in the system, e.g., Shared, Exclusive, Preemptible, Non-preemptible, Renewable.

## Method Calls

- **`this.initializeEventListeners()`**: Sets up event listeners to respond to user interactions such as input changes and button clicks.
- **`this.showLoadingIndicator(false)`**: Controls the visibility of a loading indicator. Setting it to `false` hides the loading indicator initially.
- **`this.addTooltips()`**: Adds helpful tooltips to various UI elements to provide users with more information about the available options.
- **`this.addAnimationClasses()`**: Adds CSS animation classes to enhance the visual appeal of the UI.
# Deadlock Detection and Visualization Application

## Overview

This application helps in detecting deadlocks in a system by visualizing the **Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)**. It uses the **Banker's Algorithm** to check for deadlocks and displays resource allocation and request relationships in a graphical format. The app allows the user to input the allocation and maximum matrices and visualize the process-resource relationships.

## Key Functions

### `initializeEventListeners()`
Sets up event listeners for various UI buttons. Each button triggers a specific function such as generating matrices or visualizing the RAG.

### `addTooltips()`
Adds tooltips to buttons, showing the button's text content when hovered over.

### `addAnimationClasses()`
Applies CSS animation classes to buttons and result boxes to animate them in a sequential manner based on their index.

### `showLoadingIndicator(show)`
Displays or hides a loading indicator based on the `show` parameter.

### `generateMatrices()`
Generates the matrices required for the Banker's Algorithm:
- **Total Instances Matrix**: User-defined total available instances for each resource.
- **Allocation Matrix**: User-defined allocated resources for each process.
- **Maximum Matrix**: User-defined maximum required resources for each process.

### `generateMatrix(containerId, rows, cols, prefix)`
Generates matrix input fields for the allocation or maximum matrix, appending them to the container with the provided ID. Each matrix element is an input field for user data.

### `getMatrixValues(prefix)`
Fetches the values entered in the matrices (allocation/maximum). It validates the input and returns them as a 2D array.

### `getTotalInstances()`
Retrieves the total instances of resources as entered by the user.

### `getProcessTypes()`
Gets the selected process types (CPU, Memory, etc.) from the UI.

### `getResourceTypes()`
Gets the selected resource types (Shared, Exclusive, etc.) from the UI.

### `showNotification(message, type)`
Displays notifications on the screen. Notifications can be of different types: success, error, or information.

### `visualizeRAG()`
Visualizes the Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) using the `vis.js` library. The graph shows:
- **Process nodes**: Representing processes.
- **Resource nodes**: Representing resources.
- **Edges**: Showing the relationships between processes and resources based on the allocation and request matrices.

The graph is animated, and edges are drawn sequentially to represent allocations and requests.

## Conclusion
This application is designed to help users visualize resource allocation and detect deadlocks in a system. It uses matrices for resource allocation and the Banker's Algorithm to determine the safety of resource allocation. The graphical representation helps in understanding the relationships between processes and resources.
